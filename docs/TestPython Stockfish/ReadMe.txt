This directory contains everything you need to run the test of stockfish from Python using a simple text interface.
It installs you have Python 2.7 installed.

The two other text files, are the Stockfish liscence, which needs to go with every copy and TestOutput, which shows what I got when I ran this routine.

Put all these files in a directory and run the Python program Maxchessdemo.py.
The easiest way from Windows is to Right Click and then choose "Edit with Idle"  Then from Idle: Run Module

You will get a lot of start up stuff generated by Stockfish, including some errors because my code options are out of date.
It will stop with the message:

"Enter a board message:" 

You enter a move by typing, for example "me2e4"   ie Move E2 to E4

and then go from there, see example output in TestOutput.txt



Note:
The version of stockfish here is the 64 bit version, if you have a 32 bit machine, the you will need to get that from the Stockfish site.
If you use a different version of Stockfish, make sure the program name in Maxchessdemo.py is changed.




This program plays chess using Stockfish the open source chess engine, using the ChessBoard library to manage the board.
# it is written in Python 2.7 because chessboard is. Python 3 might work but I havn't tested it.
# it assumes you have got the python libraries chessboard, subprocess and time
# it assumes stockfish is looded in the python directory.
# In this program the routines Getboard and Sendboard get a move in the for me2e4, by simple keyboard input. In the working system these get replaced by serial coms with the board
# it runs Stockfish using a list of moves not FEN. I couldn't get the FEN routines to work in ChessBoard fails after h2 h4 so #'d out
# Instead they use a move list, which is less eligent, but works.
# See full working system at : www.chess.fortherapy.co.uk
# to start try running the program and type me2e4 at the first prompt.
# This program is built using lots of examples from around the web, so do what you want with it. A credit to www.chess.fortherapy.co.uk would be nice.
